# TF Should You Eat?

Random Food Generator Android App. Solves the first world problem of figuring out what tf to eat. <br>

I'm using this project as a springboard to what I learned going through CodePath's pre-work for their Intro to Mobile App Development, **which I got accepted to for my Spring 2022 semester (yay!)**, by learning about connecting multiple activities. <br>

## App Walkthrough

## Features
- [x] 1. Introductory user screen
- [x] 2. Button that displays a random food item to the user
- [x] 3. Exit button to exit out of the app

## Future Plans
Building off the random food generator, I'm considering having an option where the user could choose to view a recipe on the web, or even provide access to any food delivery apps if they want to order the food instead of cooking. <br>

I'm also considering expanding food generator to include more foods and have selection feature where users could exclude foods they don't like or are allergic to so they don't see it when they get a randomized selection.
